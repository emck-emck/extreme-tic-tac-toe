# Extreme Tic Tac Toe

## 2022/08/03
The rules have been updated now. I have added my own images to the game now (as opposed to using ones hosted on Wikipedia).

I've uploaded version 1.0 of this game to Stackblitz. I would upload this version but they don't allow free accounts to use their own images.

## 2022/07/29
This is a project I made in July 2022. It took me a bit over a week to get it working.

Instructions on how to play the game can be found in the game itself.

I will be making refinements to this application; I'm going to update the rules and add some images to use instead of changing element background colours. The original copy (the 1.0 if you will) can be found in the branch "ettt-1.0".
