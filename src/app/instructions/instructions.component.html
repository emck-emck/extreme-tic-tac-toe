        <p class="instructions">
          The mechanics of this game are similar to the original Tic-Tac-Toe.
          Players take turns placing "X's" or "O's" (pieces) on the board with the
          objective of placing three of those pieces in a consecutive line, either
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
        </p>
        <p class="instructions">
          The board contains 9 Tic-Tac-Toe boards inside a grid which forms a
          larger Tic-Tac-Toe board (as seen below).

          The first move of the game can be on any square. Every other move is
          dictated by where the player's opponent placed their piece.
        </p>
        <p class="instructions">
          A player must play in the quadrant that corresponds to the square in
          which their opponent played on their last move (as seen below).

          Once a player has successfully won (gotten three-in-a-row) in a
          quadrant, the quadrant is no longer valid to be played in.

          It is possible that a quadrant "navigated to" has no available squares
          to play in or has already been won. Such a case is called a "hung board".
          In such a case, the next player can play in any square in any valid 
          quadrant.

          The ultimate objective of the game is to win three of the Tic-Tac-Toe 
          games; the games won forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line
          within the larger board context (as seen in the image below).
